String Manipulation Programs
This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating various string manipulation techniques. Each program focuses on a different operation, from reversing strings to counting vowels and checking for palindromes.

Programs Included
1. program_1.py - String Reversal
Description: Reverses a given string using a loop.

Usage:

python
print(reverse_string("Suraj"))  # Output: "jaruS"
Key Concept: Builds the reversed string by prepending each character.

2. program_2.py - Palindrome Checker
Description: Checks if a user-input string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

Usage:

python
Enter the value = madam  # Output: "The value entered by user is palindrome"
Key Concept: Uses slicing ([::-1]) to reverse the string and compares it with the original.

3. program_3.py - Vowel Counter
Description: Counts the occurrences of each vowel in a user-input string (case-insensitive).

Usage:

python
Enter a string value = Hello World
# Output: 
# Total vowels = 3
# a => 0
# e => 1
# i => 0
# o => 2
# u => 0
Key Concept: Uses a dictionary to track vowel counts and iterates through the string.

4. program_4.py - Space Remover
Description: Removes all spaces from a given string.

Usage:

python
Input: "Hello World" â†’ Output: "HelloWorld"
Key Concept: Uses the replace() method to eliminate spaces.
